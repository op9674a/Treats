# SnackMap
SnackMap was made using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and GoogleMaps API.

# MVP
User should be able to see a list of snacks on the opening page. User should be able to register with a username and password and then log in. Registered users have the ability to add, edit, and delete snacks.
Un-registered users only have the ability to add a new snack and must count on others to make edits.
On the snack show page, all users will see a map of locations where a particular snack can be acquired, a link to each location's official business page or a third-party review page if no official page exists. All users will also be able to click under "View more" to see a picture of the location's storefront or product and a zoomed in map for that specific location.

# Stretch Goals
Registered users will be able to leave reviews of each snack location they have visited.

Users will be able to vote on which snacks they like or dislike.

Original idea: "Treaty History" - all the same features as SnackMap, but with an added layer of also showing historical sites near each snack location. Users would be able to acquire their treats, and see if there are any historical sites of interest nearby where they can enjoy and learn!
