    description:"To straighten things up, they serve “shave ice” or shaved ice.  These are not “snow cones” with crunchy pebbles of ice, swimming in some neon artificial liquid.  These are cones of ice as fine as cotton, artfully shaven off a block, and then syruped with a choice of tropical flavors. After eating shave ice, snow cones are guaranteed to have no appeal.",
